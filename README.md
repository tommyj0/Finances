# Finances

## Overview

Simple C++ project to manage expenses



## TODO

- Make Expense its own class, encapsulate has_xxx and the expense, maybe also the way it varies

- Implement Mortgage, Car and Savings classes, inheriting from the simple expense classes

- Make an example that includes an interface
